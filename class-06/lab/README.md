# LAB: Authentication

**Authentication System Phase 1:** Deploy an Express server that implements Basic Authentication, with signup and signin capabilities, using a Mongo database for storage.

## Before you begin

Create a UML diagram of the authentication system on a whiteboard before you start

1. Refer to the *Getting Started* guide  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md)
1. Create a new repository called `basic-auth`
1. Copy the files from within the `starter-code` folder of your class repository into your new repo as a starting point
1. Work in a new branch called `dev`, created from `main`
1. Following completion of this assignment, create a Pull Request from `dev` to `main` and merge your code
   - You will deploy from your `main` branch to a new app at Heroku
   - You will add a link to the PR that you merged in your README for grading purposes

## Business Requirements

Refer to the [Authentication System Overview](../../apps-and-libraries/auth-server/README.md) for a complete review of the final application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

## Phase 1 Requirements

Today, we begin the first of a 3-Phase build of an authentication system, written in Express. The following core requirements detail the functionality for this phase of the project.

### As a user, I want to create a new account so that I may later login

- Using a tool such as `httpie`, `postman`, or a web form:
  - Make a **POST** request to the`/signup` route with `username` and `password`
  - Your server should support both JSON and FORM data as input
  - On a successful account creation, return a **201** status with the user object in the body
  - On any error, trigger your error handler with an appropriate error

### As a user, I want to login to my account so that I may access protected information

- Using a tool such as `httpie`, `postman`, or a web form:
  - Make a **POST** request to the `/signin` route
  - Send a basic authentication header with a properly encoded username and password combination
  - On a successful account login, return a **200** status with the user object in the body
  - On any error, trigger your error handler with the message "Invalid Login"

## Technical Requirements / Notes

> You have been supplied a "monolithic" express server in the `starter-code` folder which fulfills the above requirements. To complete the work for this phase, refactor the provided server using best practices, modularizing the code and providing tests, as follows:

### Basic Server

- Extract the core server logic into 2 files:
  - `index.js` (entry point)
    - Connect to the database
    - Require the 'server' and start it
  - `server.js` service wiring
    - Exports an express app/server and a start method

### Authentication Modules

Keep your authentication related files in a folder called `/auth` so they are independent of the server itself

- Extract the authentication logic for `/signin` as middleware
  - Create a new node module
  - Interact with the headers and the users model
  - Add the user record (if valid) to the request object and call `next()`
  - Call `next()` with an error in the event of a bad login
- Extract the mongo/schema into a separate module
  - Model the user data
  - Add a pre-save hook in the model ... Before we save a record:
    - Hash the plain text password given before you save a user to the database
  - Create a method in the schema to authenticate a user using the hashed password
- Create a module to house all of routes for the authentication system.
  - Create a POST route for `/signup`
    - Accepts either a JSON object or FORM Data with the keys "username" and "password"
    - Creates a new user record in a Mongo database
    - Returns a 201 with the created user record
  - Create a POST route for `/signin`
    - Use your basic authentication middleware to perform the actual login task
    - `router.post('/signin', basicAuth, (req,res) => {});`
    - When validated, send a JSON object as the response with the following properties:
      - `user`: The users' database record

### Testing

You should manually test your routes using `httpie` from the command line or an application such as Postman or Insomnia.
Additionally, you are required to write automated tests as well:

- POST to /signup to create a new user
- POST to /signin to login as a user (use basic auth)
- Need tests for auth middleware and the routes
  - Does the middleware function (send it a basic header)
  - Do the routes assert the requirements (signup/signin)
- This is going to require more "end to end" testing that you've done in the past
  - To test signin, your tests actually need to create a user first, then try and login, so there's a dependency built in
- Ensure that you use supergoose to test your routes and your database

### Visual Validation

We have deployed a web application that's designed to test your API. This is a good way to ensure that your API works as expected. There's nothing to "turn in" here, this is provided for your benefit.

- Open this [Web Application](https://javascript-401.netlify.app/)
  - Click the "Module 3 (AUTH)" / Basic Auth link
  - In the form at the top of the page, enter the URL to your Authentication Server
  - If your lab is working, this app will show your user record after you login
